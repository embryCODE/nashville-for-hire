        Nashville For Hire does not use any blanket license of ownership for the musical works made
        through our website.
        <br />
        <br />
        You (the seller) can set up terms with your customers (work for hire's, percentage
        ownerships, royalties, etc.) as you feel the need to.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless otherwise specified between yourself and the buyer, purchases of your services are
        assumed to be a work for hire that attributes all rights to the buyer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nashville For Hire receives no ownership or intellectual rights to the products, lyrics,
        songs, recordings, etc. that are transferred via nashvilleforhire.com
        <br />
        <br />
        You are a freelancer and not employed by Nashville For Hire.
        <br />
        <br />
        All orders that are initiated through Nashville For Hire must be processed and paid for
        through Nashville For Hire. We hate the culture of distrust that can exist in online
        communities, so we proactively extend trust to you that as a seller you will abide by that
        rule so we can have money to advertise and br /ing you more work and keep our business
        going.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nashville for Hire is free to use but keeps 7% of each transaction made. In addition, there
        is a standard 2.9% fee that PayPal and Credit Card Processors charge for usage. Both these
        percentages come OUT of your set price of product and are NOT IN ADDITION TO your set price,
        so your set prices remain what each customer will pay.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you “Agree” to these terms, you are claiming to live within 1 hour (driving) of
        Nashville, Tennessee.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for reading through these riveting terms of use and we are pumped to have you and
        your sweet skills on the roster.
        <br />
        <br />
        AGREE:
